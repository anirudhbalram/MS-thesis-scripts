# MS-thesis-scripts

This repository contains all scripts and jupyter notebooks used to run slick, postprocess the output files, and analyse the data products. Below you will find a list of sections briefly describing all the files/folders of this repository.

## slick

**_slick_** is a tool to calculate CO, [CI] and [CII] line intensities from extremely large datasets of clouds/galaxies in hydrodynamical simulations. It runs radiative transfer equations on each single particle of the simulation, and outputs a table with all clouds' and galaxies' luminosities for all redshifts of interest. This algorithm was designed to be used on [SIMBA](http://simba.roe.ac.uk/) simulation datasets. For more details on how to run slick and what the output quantities mean, refer to Karolina Garcia's GitHub page on [SLICK](https://github.com/karolinagarcia/slick)
